## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

1. Pull-to-refresh: bind the action to the refresh control
To bind the action to the refresh control, the documentation https://guides.codepath.com/ios/Table-View-Guide#adding-pull-to-refresh suggests to use:
```
refreshControl.addTarget(self, action: #selector(refreshControlAction(_refreshControl:)), for: UIControlEvents.valueChanged)
```
But I get a compilation error and was able to implement it by using the code below instead:
```
refreshControl.addTarget(self, action: #selector(FlicksViewController.refreshControlAction(_:)), for: UIControlEvents.valueChanged)
```
Not sure if the documentation is incorrect or different versions of XCode.
